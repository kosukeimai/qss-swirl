    These exercises are a companion to Chapter 1 of
    'Quantitative Social Science: Introduction'.

# Question 1
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'How would you multiply 4 by 7?'
  CorrectAnswer: '4 * 7'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('4 * 7', '7 * 4')
  Hint: See 'Arithmetic Operations'.

# Question 2
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'How would you multiply 2 by the result of 9 plus 1?'
  CorrectAnswer: '2 * (9 + 1)'
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs('2 * (9 + 1)', '(9 + 1) * 2', '2 * (1 + 9)', '(1 + 9) * 2')
  Hint: See 'Arithmetic Operations'.

- Class: text
  Output: >
    R will treat numbers like characters if you tell it to.
    However, you will no longer be able to use arithmetic operations
    on the object.

# Question 3
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Assign the value 10 to "myobject".'
  CorrectAnswer: 'myobject <- 10'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='myobject <- 10')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.

# Question 4
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Subtract 2 from "myobject" and call it "result".'
  CorrectAnswer: 'result <- myobject - 2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'result <- myobject - 2')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.

# Question 5
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use a function to find the class of "result".'
  CorrectAnswer: 'class(result)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= 'class(result)')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.

# Question 6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Reassign "myobject" to refer to the the characters ''10''.'
  CorrectAnswer: 'myobject <- "10"'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='myobject <- \'10\'')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.

# Question 7
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What is the value of "myobject" - 2?'
  AnswerChoices: '12; The same as "result"; It is undefined'
  CorrectAnswer: It is undefined
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'It is undefined')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.

- Class: text
  Output: >
    A vector called "x" with 10 integers from 1 to 100 has
    been included in this lesson.

# Question 8

  CorrectAnswer: 'c(x[1],x[2])'
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      'c(x[1],x[2])', 'x[c(1,2)]', 'x[1:2]', 'x[seq(2)]', 'x[seq(1, 2)]',
      'x[seq(1, 2, by = 1)]'
    )
  Hint: See 'Vectors'.

# Question 9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Find the maximum value in "x".'
  CorrectAnswer: 'max(x)'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('max(x)', 'max(x, na.rm = TRUE)')
  Hint: See 'Functions'.

- Class: text
  Output: >
    A vector of data called "world.pop" has been loaded with this lesson.
    The first element is for the year 1950 up to the last element for 2010.

- Class: text
  Output: >
    "world.pop" is a numeric vector
    so we can perform arithmetic operations on it.

# Question 10
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Divide each element of "world.pop" by 1000
    and call the result "pop.million".
  CorrectAnswer: 'pop.million <- world.pop / 1000'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pop.million <- world.pop / 1000')
  Hint: See 'Vectors'.

- Class: text
  Output: >
    Included in this lesson is a CSV data file called "data.csv".
    For convenience, the file path to "data.csv" is called "data_path".

# Question 11
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Find the value of "data_path".'
  CorrectAnswer: 'data_path'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data_path')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.

# Question 12
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Using "data_path" as the path,
    read the content of the data file and call it "df".
  CorrectAnswer: 'df <- read.csv(data_path, header = TRUE)'
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      'df <- read.csv(data_path, header = TRUE)',
      'df <- read.csv(data_path, header = T)',
      'df <- read.csv(data_path)'
    )
  Hint: See 'Data Files'.

- Class: text
  Output: >
    A data frame object called "UNpop" has already been included in this lesson.

# Question 13

  Hint: See 'Data Files'.

# Question 15

  Output: >
    Use indexing and/or the $ operator to look at the last four observations
    of the "year" variable from the "UNpop" data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: 'UNpop$year[4:7]'
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      'UNpop[4:7, "year"]', 'UNpop[4:7, 2]', 'UNpop$year[4:7]',

      'UNpop[c(4, 5, 6, 7), "year"]',
      'UNpop[c(4, 5, 6, 7), 2]',
      'UNpop[c(4:7), "year"]', 'UNpop[c(4:7), 2]', 'UNpop$year[c(4:7)]',
      'UNpop$year[seq(from = 4, to = 7)]',
      'UNpop$year[seq(from = 4, to = 7, by = 1)]',
      'UNpop[(dim(UNpop)[1] - 3):dim(UNpop)[1], "year"]',
      'UNpop[(dim(UNpop)[1] - 3):dim(UNpop)[1], 2]',
      'UNpop$year[(dim(UNpop)[1] - 3):dim(UNpop)[1]]',
      'UNpop[c((dim(UNpop)[1] - 3):dim(UNpop)[1]), "year"]',
      'UNpop[c((dim(UNpop)[1] - 3):dim(UNpop)[1]), 2]',
      'UNpop$year[c((dim(UNpop)[1] - 3):dim(UNpop)[1])]',
      'UNpop$year[seq(from = dim(UNpop)[1] - 3, to = dim(UNpop)[1])]',
      'UNpop$year[seq(from = dim(UNpop)[1] - 3, to = dim(UNpop)[1], by = 1)]'
    )
  Hint: See 'Data Files'.

- Class: text
  Output: >
    Notice that you have to quote the name of the variable
    if you index into "UNpop", but not if you use the dollar sign.

# Question 16
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    R uses a special character to denote comments.
    Use the "print()" function to write 'X starts every comment'.
    Replace X with the appropriate character.
  CorrectAnswer: 'print("# starts every comment")'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='print("# starts every comment")')
  Hint: See 'Data Files'.

# Question 17
